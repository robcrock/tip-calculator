## My process

1. Scaffold the Next App
2. Remove Boilerplate
3. Add starter code from FEM
4. Get the app functional
5. Nail the Layout + Responsive
6. Nail the Font
7. Nail the color
8. Nail the interactivity

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/)
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

### What I learned

This was the most interactive challene I have faced so far. I expected to create a form and call it a day, but the layout wasn't standard. This meant that I needed to use React Hook Form in ways I hadn't before. I was also using areas of shadcn that I hadn't been using before. All that to say, this was more challenging than I expected, but I appreciate the challenge because that's where the real learning happens.

### Continued development

I'm going to look for another form challenge to build out. I think they're great practice and I have a lot to learn about how to get the most out of shadcn/ui + NextJS and React Hook Form.

### Useful resources

- [Adding Icons to shadcn/ui Inputs](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/discussions/1552) - This thread provided a great example of how to add icons to the shadcn input components.
- [svg2jsx](https://svg2jsx.com/) - This was a super simple way to convert SVGs to JSX components.
